# Notarizes + staples an already-signed SPAStrip macOS installer pkg,
# independent of whatever notarytool keychain profile happens to exist on this
# machine. Same mechanism and order as SPASynth's scripts/notarize.sh, and it
# deliberately REUSES SPASynth's credentials file and variable names, so there
# is nothing new to set up:
#
#   ./scripts/notarize.sh <pkg>
#
#   1. ~/.config/spasynth/notary.env, if present: a shell file (mode 600,
#      created by hand, NEVER inside a repo) defining
#        SPASYNTH_NOTARY_APPLE_ID, SPASYNTH_NOTARY_TEAM_ID, SPASYNTH_NOTARY_PASSWORD
#      submitted via `notarytool ... --apple-id --team-id --password`.
#   2. Otherwise, the keychain profile named by SPASYNTH_NOTARIZE_PROFILE
#      (e.g. SPASYNTH_NOTARY), via `notarytool ... --keychain-profile`.
#   3. If neither is usable, prints instructions and exits 69 without touching
#      the pkg.
#
# After a successful submission it staples the ticket, validates the staple and
# requires Gatekeeper to report the pkg as "Notarized Developer ID".
#
# The password is never echoed and this script never sets -x. Passing it as a
# notarytool argument (visible in `ps` for the instant the process runs) is
# accepted, as in SPASynth, since this is a single-user dev Mac.

error: no working notarization credentials.

Fix one of these:
  1. (preferred) Create $ENV_FILE by hand, mode 600, with:
       SPASYNTH_NOTARY_APPLE_ID=your-apple-id@example.com
       SPASYNTH_NOTARY_TEAM_ID=7K9WY5T49S
       SPASYNTH_NOTARY_PASSWORD=an-app-specific-password
  2. Or recreate the keychain profile in Terminal.app (not this shell):
       xcrun notarytool store-credentials SPASYNTH_NOTARY \\
         --apple-id <id> --team-id 7K9WY5T49S
     and make sure SPASYNTH_NOTARIZE_PROFILE=SPASYNTH_NOTARY is exported.

Then re-run: $0 "$PKG"
